Vigenere Cipher
----------------------


What:
-----

This is a active running program to decode a text file, using the Vigenere Cipher by simply asking a user for the code word.


How:
1. Determine where all your files are.

2. Open up terminal and change directories according to the location of the files.
(ls (figure where your files are), cd (change directory to appropriate place))

3. Make sure the text that you want to decode is in the message_cipher.txt file and the file that you want the clear message to be written on is in the message_cipher_clear.txt

4. Once ready, run the file through python3. 
(example:~/Desktop$ python3 vigeneredecipher.py )

5. If done correctly, the text file named, message_cipher_clear.txt, should obtain the message that you decoded line by line.

6. *Current codes that are provided will need a code word of "lime" for it to be clear.
